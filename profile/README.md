# Cookiecutter Templates

This is a collection of public cookiecutter templates I use to simplify my workflow. I've made them public in case others want to use them. Feel free to fork them if you want to modify a component of the template.

## Templates

### Visual Studio Code

Some aspects of the templates may be specific to VSCode - as this is what I'm using (mostly extensions, maybe some other stuff).
